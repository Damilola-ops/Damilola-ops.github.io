        <h1>Building Intelligent Machine</h1>
      </div>
      <h2>Hi I'm Damilola,</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        A passionate and driven software engineering student with a deep
        fascination for the intersection of technology and intelligence.
        Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering from the University
        of Lagos, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to contribute
        meaningfully in the field of machine learning engineering.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in
        software engineering principles and practices. My coursework has
        provided me with hands-on experience in designing and implementing
        robust software solutions. However, what truly ignites my curiosity is
        the realm of machine learning. I am captivated by the idea of creating
        algorithms that learn and adapt from data, ultimately translating them
        into real-world applications that have the potential to revolutionize
        industries.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I have actively engaged in personal projects and research initiatives
        that showcase my dedication to the world of machine learning. From
        building predictive models for real estate trends to exploring natural
        language processing applications, I have honed my skills in data
        preprocessing, building end-end training pipelines, cloud
        infrastructures and CI/CD tools while imploring software engineering
        best practices . These experiences have not only expanded my technical
        toolkit but have also taught me the importance of creativity and
        adaptability in problem-solving.
