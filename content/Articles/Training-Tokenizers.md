## 

The first step to training a foundational language model on a new language is to train a tokenizer. In this article, we would be focusing on the challenges that arise when training tokenizers on large datasets, in particular, Byte-Pair-Encoding Tokenizers. 

If you weren't already familiar with Byte-Pair-Encoding, You can check out Karpathy's(link to karpathy BPE) video or an article I wrote a while ago[ðŸ‘€](https://damilojohn.github.io/posts/BPE)


Training a BPE tokenizer is a CPU and memory intensive tasks that can get out of hand pretty quickly. In this article, we would be trying to train a SentencePiece BPE tokenizer on a multilingual dataset with 13 million rows!!.
