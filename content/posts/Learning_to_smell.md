The title of this post might be a little confusing but what we are really going to do is to try and build a model to classify smells from their molecular compounds. This little project intertwines realms of chemistry and machine learning and it doesn't get more interesting than that. 


## Dataset 




## Visualizing molecules 




## Evaluation metrics 




## Model 





## Conclusions
