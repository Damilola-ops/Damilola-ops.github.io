The title of this post might be a little confusing but what we are really going to do is to try and build a model to classify smells from their molecular compounds. This little project intertwines realms of chemistry and machine learning and it doesn't get more interesting than that. 

Our noses have more than 400 types of olfactory receptors expressed in 1 million+ olfactory sensory neurons, which are all on a small tissue - olfactory epithelium. The olfactory sensory neurons send signals to the olfactory bulb in the brain and then to more structures from there, to understand the smell.

We are turning this process digital!

In our noses, what finally goes in are particles that have odorant molecules responsible for the smell. These molecules are the actual building blocks of all fragrances. For this challenge, we take these molecular compounds as an input, parse them through, and predict what multitude of fragrances they contain out of 100+ different ones.
