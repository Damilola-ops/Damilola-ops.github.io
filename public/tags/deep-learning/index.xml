      <description>This is a fun side project where I explored transformers based sentiment classification for the first time by training BERT to identify 15 of the most popular programming languages.
i startED with simple machine learning approaches and gradually work our way up to more complex methods till we have a satisfactory solution.
The Dataset Our dataset is a csv containing 45,000 samples. The dataset is made up of two columns, the &amp;lsquo;code&amp;rsquo; feature contains code snippets we want to classify and the language column, which is our label contains the programming language it belongs to.</description>

      <description>Tokenization is an umbrella term for the methods used to turn texts into chunks of words or sub-words. Tokenization has a lot of applications in computer science, from compilers to Natural Language Processing. In this article, we would be focusing on tokenizers in Language models, in particular, a method of tokenization called Byte Pair Encoding. The last few years have witnessed a revolution in NLP catalyzed mainly by the introduction of the transformers architecture in 2017 with the paper &amp;lsquo;Attention is all you need &amp;rsquo; epitomized by the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022.</description>

      <description>And Enhance!! (from Blade Runner ), that&amp;rsquo;s Computational Photography .
Computational photography describes signal processing techniques and algorithms that allow computers to replicate photographic processes like motion - blur correction , auto-focus ,depth-sensing , zoom and other features that would otherwise be impossible without optics ,while some of these processes use artificial intelligence techniques, Computational Photography is more than just AI , it involves a series of process like that takes an image from the Ones and Zeros on captured by image signal sensors and process to the final image displayed on screens .</description>
