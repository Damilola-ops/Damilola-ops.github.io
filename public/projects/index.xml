      <description>Finetuning GPT2 to Reconstruct sentences Two words are anagrams if one can be formed by permuting the letters of the other. Applying the same logic to a sentence, would be saying that two sentences are anagrams(no such thing) if their component words can be permutated to form clones of each other.
I thought it would be interesting to finetune a language model to do this. You might be thinking that simply re-arranging words in a sentence doesn&amp;rsquo;t require intelligence and can be done with very trivial algorithms,you would be right, but I added an edge to this task, given a random sequence of words, the language model has to return a grammatically correct sequence using the same set of words.</description>
