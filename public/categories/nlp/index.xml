      <description>Introduction Over the last few years, Transformers have emerged as the de-facto deep learning architecture in language models. Fundamentally changing the field of machine learning and Artificial intelligence as a whole. Their unprecendented success in solving complex language tasks, reasoning (or mimmicking it) in solving math and coding problems, have ushered in a new era in AI, powering successful AI products like ChatGPT.
The key innovation of transformers lies in the self-attention mechanism, which allows each tokens in the input sequence to directly interact with every other token in the sequence.</description>

      <title>Finetuning GPT2 to Reconstruct Sentences</title>

      <description>Two words are anagrams if one can be formed by permuting the letters of the other. Applying the same logic to a sentence, would be saying that two sentences are anagrams(no such thing) if their component words can be permutated to form clones of each other.
I thought it would be interesting to teach a language model to do this. You might be thinking that simply re-arranging words in a sentence doesn&amp;rsquo;t require intelligence and can be done with very trivial algorithms,you would be right, but I added an edge to this task, given a random sequence of words, the language model has to return a grammatically correct sequence using the same set of words.</description>
