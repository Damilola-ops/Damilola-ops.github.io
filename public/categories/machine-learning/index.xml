      <description>Playlist Generator An app that uses semantic search to generate afrobeat song playlists from input texts This is a side project where I built an end-to-end machine learning application that uses a sentence transformer model hosted as a model-as-a-service. It is a simple recommendation system that tries to find afrobeat songs about a user&amp;rsquo;s sentiment by comparing the user&amp;rsquo;s text inputs to song lyrics and then return the most similar songs.</description>

      <description>Tokenization is an umbrella term for the methods used to turn texts into chunks of words or sub-words. Tokenization has a lot of applications in computer science, from compilers to Natural Language Processing. In this article, we would be focusing on tokenizers in Language models, in particular, a method of tokenization called Byte Pair Encoding. The last few years have witnessed a revolution in NLP catalyzed mainly by the introduction of the transformers architecture in 2017 with the paper &amp;lsquo;Attention is all you need &amp;rsquo; epitomized by the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022.</description>

      <description>And Enhance!! (from Blade Runner ), that&amp;rsquo;s Computational Photography .
Computational photography describes signal processing techniques and algorithms that allow computers to replicate photographic processes like motion - blur correction , auto-focus ,depth-sensing , zoom and other features that would otherwise be impossible without optics ,while some of these processes use artificial intelligence techniques, Computational Photography is more than just AI , it involves a series of process like that takes an image from the Ones and Zeros on captured by image signal sensors and process to the final image displayed on screens .</description>
