      <description>Docking to the ISS would have been more fun if we actually had to dock with the international space station, regardless, we have an interesting problem of trying to create an automatic ISS docker by estimating the coordinates and distance of the international space station from images.
In this article , we would be using deep learning to estimate the coordinates of an object in an image and also training the model to predict the distance of images .</description>

      <description>And Enhance!! (from Blade Runner ), that&amp;rsquo;s Computational Photography .
Computational photography describes signal processing techniques and algorithms that allow computers to replicate photographic processes like motion - blur correction , auto-focus ,depth-sensing , zoom and other features that would otherwise be impossible without optics ,while some of these processes use artificial intelligence techniques, Computational Photography is more than just AI , it involves a series of process like that takes an image from the Ones and Zeros on captured by image signal sensors and process to the final image displayed on screens .</description>
