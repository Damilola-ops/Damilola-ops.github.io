      <description>Playlist Generator An app that uses semantic search to generate afrobeat song playlists from input texts This is a side project where I built an end-to-end machine learning application that uses a sentence transformer model hosted as a model-as-a-service. It is a simple recommendation system that tries to find afrobeat songs about a user&amp;rsquo;s sentiment by comparing the user&amp;rsquo;s text inputs to song lyrics and then return the most similar songs.</description>
